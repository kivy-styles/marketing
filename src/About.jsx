                    Hey again!! So lets take a short trip down memory lane,
                    I'm going to tell you how my journey began and how I got to know about
                    Expertnaire. To be honest, I was initially unaware of the boundless
                    opportunities the online platform had to offer especially when
                    it comes to helping one gain financial freedom. All I believed or was
                    made to believe at the time, was just going to school, study a good course,
                    and if your fortunate enough, get a good job that pays at least 200k monthly and given the
                    current socio-economic and financial situation in Nigeria even that is hard to
                    come-by despite having the right qualifications.

                    Personally, I find myself quite priviledged and was lucky enough to have parents who were
                    both well educated, well to do and had well paying jobs so my childhood to teenage years
                    went relatively smooth but then came 2020! You might want to sit down for this!! Some may call
                    it the start of my own origin story. So, fast forward to 2020, the global outbreak of the Corona virus and
                    the underlying nationwide strike made things really difficult. I was stuck at home with absolutely nothing
                    to do and my dad had recently stopped giving me allowance since I wasn't going to school, So I was
                    left dancing in distress financially till my elder brother came to my rescue and resumed giving
                    me monthly allowances, this was quite an eye-opener for me and I asked myself 'Am I going to keep depending
                    on my parents and brothers for financial assistance? I'm an Adult'. I started to act towards achieving this goal.

                    On October 2021, I was hearing and seeing Whatsapp statuses about a certain digital marketing platform called Expertnaire and I saw
                    numerous testimonies about it online and offline but I wasn't sure about it especially since I've been recently scammed
                    by an online platform which claimed to be involved in Affiliate marketing so I was understandably
                    apprehensive about this new platform. A couple of my friends finally succeeded in persuading me to join, they educated
                    me on what it was really all about, and that it was neither a pyramid nor a ponzi scheme like I had initially thought so I decided to
                    give it a try which turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. The only problem now was getting the money to purchase the 721G package
                    which at the time was 50k. Luckily for me I had a friend who lived overseas who was willing to assist me with the money after
                    I informed him about my predicament, that was how i was able to pay for the 72IG package - I know this wasn't much of a
                    tragic origin story but trust me, it felt tragic at the time.

                    Now back to the present. You might now ask the question 'Why am I telling you all these?' Well there are people who are in far
                    worse condition than I was, Expertnaire offers the best opportunity for you to make money online with just your smart phone from
                    the comfort of your own home and gain financial freedom, so my job is to assist you to achieve your goal All it takes is discipline and patience.
                    Also I'm aware the start-up amount is a lot but trust me its worth every penny, once you start making millions the registration fee
                    will look like a bargain so why not take the chance. I have made one of the most important decisions in my life, it is time to make yours.
